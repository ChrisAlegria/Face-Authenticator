# Predictive Analysis for Retail Store

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for a retail store to forecast sales based on various characteristics. The goal is to predict total sales for the next month using data from previous months.

## Description

The project involves several steps including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, model training and evaluation, and providing recommendations based on findings. We use a dataset containing information on sales, day of the week, promotions, holidays, and more.

## Installation and Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook files to see the analysis and results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.

## File Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing the Jupyter notebooks for each step of the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation file.
